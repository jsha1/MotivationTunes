# Motivation Tunes

A simple script inteded to be run on an Android phone to be able to download youtube videos and convert to mp3s. 
The original purpose was to provide me with music for the gym. You are able to specify playlists to sync with
and whenever you run the script it will check to see if there are new videos to download and convert. 


## Installation

Install QPython on your android phone through the app store. 

via QPython install (via pip)

Sqlite3
pafy (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pafy)
youtube-dl (https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html)

## Usage

You can either look for existing playlists on Youtube and add it to the configuration file and/or you can create your own public playlist on youtube so that if you come across a video you want to for later, just add it to your playlist

Run the python script via QPython to download and convert new videos
